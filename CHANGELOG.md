# Changelog

All notable changes to **auto-all-Antigravity** will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.11] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Auto-recovery when CDP connections lost**: If Antigravity is restarted by external tools (like Antigravity Manager) without debugging enabled, the extension now detects this and prompts to relaunch with CDP enabled.
- CDP health tracking with 1-minute cooldown to prevent prompt spam.

### Fixed
- Extension now properly recovers when Antigravity Manager switches accounts and restarts Antigravity windows.

### Notes
- For seamless operation with Antigravity Manager, ensure `gui_config.json` has both `antigravity_executable` and `antigravity_args` set with `--remote-debugging-port=9000`.
