# Changelog

All notable changes to **auto-all-Antigravity** will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Antigravity/Gemini Menu Flashing & Focus Theft**: Hardened `full_cdp_script.js` to fail closed in Antigravity mode unless elements are inside the agent interaction panel. This prevents global menu/toolbar scans from triggering the `Always run` permission dropdown and stealing keyboard focus.
- **Antigravity Multi-Tab UI Jank (related)**: Restricted Antigravity tab queries/switches to the agent panel instead of broad document scans, reducing accidental UI interactions that amplify flashing and scroll slowdown in `Multi` mode.

### Changed

- **Antigravity Mode Safety Behavior**: Disabled `clickAlwaysRunDropdown()` automation in Antigravity/Gemini mode. Core auto-accept remains active, but the permission dropdown is no longer auto-clicked in this IDE mode to avoid menu flashing regressions.
- **Antigravity Focus Stability**: Debounced focus-triggered away-action checks and suppressed away-action toast popups in Antigravity mode to reduce residual keyboard focus theft after the flashing hotfix.

## [1.0.28] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **Auto-Accept Completely Broken**: Fixed critical bug where `isInConversationArea()` defaulted to rejecting all buttons when Antigravity updated its DOM structure. Changed default from reject to accept — the exclusion list (sidebar, editor, toolbar) remains the active guard against erratic clicking.
- **Auto-Expand Not Clicking "Expand >"**: Fixed `expandCollapsedSections()` using exact text match (`=== 'expand'`) which didn't match Antigravity's "Expand >" link text. Now uses `startsWith('expand')` for resilient matching.
- **Button Text Contamination**: Improved button text extraction with `getButtonOwnText()` to prevent "Always run" checkbox text from contaminating nearby "Run All" button detection.
- **"Always Run" Clicked Repeatedly**: Added `always run`, `always allow`, `always proceed`, `always auto` to the reject list in `isAcceptButton()` — the dedicated `clickAlwaysRunDropdown()` (one-shot) now handles it exclusively.

### Improved

- **3x Faster Response Time**: Reduced multi-tab loop delays from ~2.8s to ~1.0s per cycle (expand: 300→150ms, post-click: 500→200ms, tab-switch: 800→300ms, cycle-end: 1500→400ms)
- **Always Run Dropdown**: `clickAlwaysRunDropdown()` now called in both single-tab and multi-tab loops

---

## [1.0.27] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **Auto-Accept Not Clicking Buttons**: Fixed critical bug where "Run All" and other accept buttons were not being clicked. The button text extraction was picking up "Always run" checkbox text from nearby UI elements, causing the reject filter to block legitimate buttons.
- **Smarter Button Text Extraction**: New `getButtonOwnText()` function extracts only the button's direct text nodes, preventing false-positive rejections from neighboring elements like checkboxes and labels.
- **Removed False Reject Patterns**: Removed `'always run'`, `'always allow'`, `'always proceed'` from the reject list — these are handled separately by the dedicated dropdown handler and were causing unintended button rejections.

---

## [1.0.26] - 2026-02-17

### Added

- **Sponsor Button**: Added `sponsor` field to `package.json` — Ko-Fi link now appears as a prominent "Sponsor" button on the extension page in Antigravity/VS Code
- **Enhanced Ko-Fi Visibility**: Ko-Fi support section is now prominently placed in the README right after Key Features
- **Richer Metadata**: Added `homepage`, `bugs`, and `qna` fields to `package.json` for better marketplace links

---

## [1.0.25] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **"Step Requires Input" Auto-Expand**: Rewrote `expandCollapsedSections()` to reliably find and click the "Expand" button next to "N Step Requires Input" messages. Uses two strategies: first finds the step message text and clicks nearby expand elements, then falls back to broader search within the agent panel.
- **Erratic Clicking on Sidebar/Navigation**: Added `isInConversationArea()` guard that restricts auto-clicking to the agent/conversation panel only. Buttons in the sidebar, file explorer, activity bar, editor area, title bar, and status bar are now excluded.
- **Single-Tab Mode Expand**: The static single-tab polling loop now also calls `expandCollapsedSections()` before clicking accept buttons, matching the behavior of the multi-tab `antigravityLoop`.

---

## [1.0.23] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Auto-Expand Collapsed Sections**: Extension now automatically clicks "Expand" on collapsed step sections (e.g., "1 Step Requires Input") to reveal hidden buttons that need approval
- Added `'run all'` explicitly to default accept patterns

### Fixed

- **Button text detection**: Increased text length limit from 50 to 100 chars, fixing cases where "Run All" and other buttons weren't being detected
- Improved text extraction for complex buttons with nested child elements

---

## [1.0.22] - 2026-02-08

### Improved

- **Faster Auto-Accept Response Times**: Reduced all polling delays by ~60%
  - Button polling: 800-1500ms → 300-500ms
  - Tab switch delay: 2000ms → 800ms
  - Cycle wait: 3000-5000ms → 1000-1500ms
  - Single-tab mode: 1000ms → 500ms default

---

## [1.0.21] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- **Complete Dropdown Fix**: Removed 'always allow' and 'always auto' from accept patterns in all files
  - Extension now fully ignores "Always run" / "Ask every time" permission dropdowns
  - Fixed issue where dropdown patterns were still in settings-panel.js defaults

---

## [1.0.20] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- **Dropdown Items Excluded**: Added 'always run' and 'always allow' to reject list

  - Only clicks actual accept/run buttons, not permission dropdown options

---

## [1.0.19] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

---

## [1.0.16] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed

- **Expanded auto-accept button patterns**: Now catches permission dialogs like "Always Allow", "Allow Once", "Proceed", "Continue", "Yes", "OK", "Save", etc.
- **Wider button selectors**: The antigravity loop now scans for general buttons and role="button" elements in addition to `.bg-ide-button-background`, fixing issues where permission prompts weren't being auto-accepted.

---

## [1.0.15] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed

- **Auto-CDP now runs on startup**: Fixed bug where auto-CDP setup only ran when the extension was already enabled. Now it always ensures CDP is available on Antigravity startup, even for fresh installs or when previously disabled.

---

## [1.0.14] - 2026-01-15

### Changed

- **Auto-CDP Setup**: Extension now automatically relaunches Antigravity with CDP enabled on first activation, removing the need for manual "Setup & Restart" approval.

---

## [1.0.13] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- GitHub Actions workflow now handles re-runs gracefully when version is already published.

---

## [1.0.12] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: Automatic publishing to Open VSX when version tags are pushed.

---

## [1.0.11] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- **Auto-recovery when CDP connections lost**: If Antigravity is restarted by external tools (like Antigravity Manager) without debugging enabled, the extension now detects this and prompts to relaunch with CDP enabled.
- CDP health tracking with 1-minute cooldown to prevent prompt spam.

### Fixed

- Extension now properly recovers when Antigravity Manager switches accounts and restarts Antigravity windows.

### Notes

- For seamless operation with Antigravity Manager, ensure `gui_config.json` has both `antigravity_executable` and `antigravity_args` set with `--remote-debugging-port=9000`.
