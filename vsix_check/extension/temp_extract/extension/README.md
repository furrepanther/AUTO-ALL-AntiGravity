## 🚀 True Autonomous Coding

**Tired of clicking "Approve" every 30 seconds?**

Auto Accept ALL transforms Antigravity into a fully autonomous coding partner. It silently handles the repetitive approval prompts for file edits, terminal commands, and agent recovery, letting your AI work continuously while you focus on the big picture.

**✨ 100% Free. No Paywalls. No Limits.**

## ⚡ Why Use Auto Accept ALL?

Native Antigravity is powerful but needy. It pauses constantly for user input, breaking your flow and the agent's momentum.

We fix that by automating the routine checks:

| Feature | Standard Antigravity | With Auto Accept ALL |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **File Edits** | 🛑 Waits for click | ✅ **Instant Apply** |
| **Terminal Commands** | 🛑 Waits for approval | ✅ **Auto-Execute** |
| **Stuck Agents** | 🛑 Manual restart needed | ✅ **Auto-Recover** |
| **Workflow** | 🐌 Interrupted | ⚡ **Continuous** |
