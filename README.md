# Auto Accept ALL AntiGravity

## Run 3 AI agents in parallel. Zero babysitting.

Stop watching tabs. Auto Accept ALL keeps every Antigravity conversation moving — accepting file edits, terminal commands, and recovery prompts automatically.

**All features unlocked. Free forever.**

---

## Why Auto Accept ALL?

Antigravity's multi-agent workflow is powerful, but it stops every time the agent needs approval. 

**That's dozens of interruptions per hour.**

Auto Accept ALL eliminates the wait:
- ✅ **File edits** — Auto-applied
- ✅ **Terminal commands** — Auto-executed
- ✅ **Retry prompts** — Auto-confirmed
- ✅ **Stuck agents** — Auto-recovered

---

## ✨ All Features Included

### Multi-Tab Mode
Run multiple Antigravity tabs simultaneously. Every conversation auto-accepts in the background — no tab-switching required.

### Dangerous Command Blocking
Built-in protection against destructive commands like `rm -rf /`. Fully customizable blocklist.

### Real-time Status Overlay
Visual indicators show conversation state:
- **Purple** — In progress, actively polling
- **Green** — Task completed

### Adjustable Polling Speed
Configure how fast the extension polls for pending actions.

### Stuck Agent Recovery
Automatically recovers agents that get stuck waiting for approval.

### Works Everywhere
- ✅ Antigravity
- ✅ Cursor
- ✅ Multiple windows
- ✅ Minimized/unfocused
