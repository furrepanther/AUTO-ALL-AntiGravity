Stop watching tabs. Auto Accept ALL keeps every Antigravity conversation moving — accepting file edits, terminal commands, and recovery prompts automatically.

**✨ All Pro features unlocked. Free forever.**

## Why Auto Accept ALL?

Antigravity's multi-agent workflow is powerful, but it stops every time the agent needs approval.

**That's dozens of interruptions per hour.**

Auto Accept ALL eliminates the wait:

| Action | Status |
|--------|--------|
| File edits | ✅ Auto-applied |
| Terminal commands | ✅ Auto-executed |
| Retry prompts | ✅ Auto-confirmed |
| Stuck agents | ✅ Auto-recovered |

## ✨ Features

### 🔄 Multi-Tab Mode
Run multiple Antigravity tabs simultaneously. Every conversation auto-accepts in the background — no tab-switching required.

### 🛡️ Dangerous Command Blocking
Built-in protection against destructive commands like `rm -rf /`. Fully customizable blocklist.

### 📊 Real-time Status Overlay
Visual indicators show conversation state:
- **Purple** — In progress, actively polling
- **Green** — Task completed

### ⚡ Adjustable Polling Speed
Configure how fast the extension polls for pending actions.

### 🔧 Stuck Agent Recovery
Automatically recovers agents that get stuck waiting for approval.

- ✅ Antigravity
